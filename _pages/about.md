I am currently pursuing my DPhil. (Phd.) in Computer Science at the <a href="http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk">University of Oxford</a>, UK. My research interests are: security protocols, Internet security, and applied cryptography. 

I hold a MSc. degree in Information Security from <a href="http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/prospective_students/msc_information_security/">University College London (UCL)</a>. My master thesis examined the security of RSA public-keys, in particular, it examined the factorable RSA keys issue in TLS servers on the Internet. Previously, I obtained BSc. in Computer Science from King Abdulaziz University <a href="http://www.kau.edu.sa/home_ENGLISH.aspx">KAU</a>.

When I have time I enjoy learning new things, especially those related to computer science. I also enjoy reading and art work. Some of my very old art work can be found <a href="https://www.behance.net/ealashwali/">here </a>. 

Some of the interesting career experiences I had are: 
<ul>
<li> The recipient of the <strong>BEST PAPER AWARD</strong> at SecureComm 2019 for our <a href="/publications/towards_fs.pdf">paper here</a>.</li> 
<li> Research internship at <a href="https://www.sutd.edu.sg">SUTD</a>, Singapore in 2018.</li> 
<li> Invited by Google (Munich office) within top selected Phd. and Post-doctoral researchers from around Europe for the Google Web Security Summit 2018.</li> 
<li> The recipient of IEEE R8 Clementina Saduwa Award for Women in Engineering 2015. </li>
<li> The founding lecturer of the first Student Hacking Competition at CCIT-KAU in 2015. </li> 
<li> The first Head of the Labs & Technical Support Unit at CCIT-KAU (2008 - 2011). </li>
<li> The founding lecturer of the Network Lab at the College of Computing & IT (CCIT) in KAU 2007. </li>
<li> The recipient of the IEEE R8 Exemplary Student Branch Counselor 2015. </li>
