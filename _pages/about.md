I am currently pursuing my DPhil. (Phd.) in Computer Science at the <a href="http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk">University of Oxford</a>, UK. My research interests are: security protocols, Internet security, and applied cryptography. 

I hold a MSc. degree in Information Security from <a href="http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/prospective_students/msc_information_security/">University College London (UCL)</a>. My master thesis examined the security of RSA public keys, in particular, it examined the factorable RSA keys issue in TLS servers on the Internet. Previously, I obtained BSc. in Computer Science from King Abdulaziz University <a href="http://www.kau.edu.sa/home_ENGLISH.aspx">KAU</a>.

When I have time I enjoy learning new things, especially those related to computer science. I also enjoy reading and art work. Some of my very old art work can be found <a href="https://www.behance.net/ealashwali/">here </a>.

I am from Saudi Arabia. I had the pleasure to visit and live in different parts of this world. I visited the US, Singapore (lived for 5 months), Malaysia, Germany, France, Italy, Croatia, Slovenia, Estonia, Poland, and Egypt. I also lived in the UK for over 6 years.
