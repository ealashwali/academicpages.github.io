I am currently pursuing my DPhil. (Phd.) in Computer Science at the <a href="http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk">University of Oxford</a>, UK. 

I work as a Lecturer in the College of Computing & IT (CCIT) at <a href="http://www.kau.edu.sa/home_ENGLISH.aspx"> King Abdulaziz University (KAU) </a>. Prior to that, I worked in various network and technical support positions in IT departments at different academic institutions: <a href="http://www.dah.edu.sa">Dar Al-Hekma University</a>, <a href="http://www.effatuniversity.edu.sa">Effat University</a>, and <a href="http://www.fikr.edu.sa/">Dar Al-Fikr Schools</a>.

I hold a MSc. degree in Information Security from <a href="http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/prospective_students/msc_information_security/">University College London (UCL)</a>. My master thesis examined the security of RSA public-keys, in particular, it examined the factorable RSA keys issue in TLS servers on the Internet. Previously, I obtained BSc. in Computer Science from <a href="http://www.kau.edu.sa/home_ENGLISH.aspx"> KAU</a>.

Some of the interesting career experiences I had are: being an Oxford First-Generation Student Ambassador of Oriel College 2018, invited by Google (Munich office) for their Web Security Summit 2018, the recipient of IEEE R8 Clementina Saduwa Award for Women in Engineering 2015, the recipient of the IEEE R8 Exemplary Student Branch Counselor 2015, the first Head of the Labs & Technical Support Unit at the College of Computing & IT (CCIT) at <a href="http://www.kau.edu.sa/home_ENGLISH.aspx">KAU</a> (2008 - 2011), the founding lecturer of the Network Lab at CCIT-KAU in 2007, and the founding lecturer of the first Student Hacking Competition at CCIT-KAU in 2015.
